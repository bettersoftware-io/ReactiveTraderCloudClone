/**
 * Hold-to-unlock gesture: fills `progress` 0→1 over `HOLD_MS` while the ring
 * is held, calling `onComplete` exactly once when the hold activates (native
 * `minDuration`, not a per-frame callback). Releasing early — or after a
 * completed hold — decays `progress` back to 0 over `DECAY_MS`, never a snap.
 *
 * `onComplete` is read through a ref reassigned unconditionally on every
 * render (the `ExecutionCeremony` once-guard idiom, generalised here to "the
 * ref always mirrors the latest closure" rather than "detect a transition") —
 * the `gesture` object itself is memoised once (stable identity, so
 * `GestureDetector` isn't reconfigured on every keystroke of the password
 * field), but its handlers always call the *current* `onComplete` — the
 * caller's current typed password, in `LockScreen`'s case.
 *
 * Motion gating: this is an authentication control, not decoration, so it
 * must stay operable under reduced-motion/Freeze. When
 * `useShellMotionEnabled()` is off, the fill/decay become discrete jumps
 * instead of a `withTiming` sweep — the hold-to-complete timing itself
 * (native `minDuration`) is unaffected, only the cosmetic ring sweep is
 * skipped. The discrete fill jump lands on `.onStart` (hold ACTIVATION —
 * fires after the native `minDuration`, when a real unlock is imminent), not
 * `.onBegin` (touch-down); the animated (motion-enabled) sweep still starts
 * on `.onBegin` as before, since it's meant to visually track the whole
 * hold. The decay-to-0 jump stays on `.onFinalize` either way.
 *
 * `motionEnabled` is threaded into the worklet through `motionEnabledShared`
 * — a `SharedValue<boolean>` kept in sync with the `useShellMotionEnabled()`
 * prop by the `useEffect` below — rather than a plain `useRef`. `LockScreen`
 * returns `null` while unlocked and never unmounts, so `gesture` (and its
 * worklet closures) is built once at boot; a `useRef` object read inside a
 * worklet callback is captured BY COPY at worklet-build time on the UI
 * thread — only a `SharedValue` stays live across the JS/UI-thread boundary.
 * A ref would freeze `motionEnabled` at boot forever, so a later Freeze/OS
 * reduced-motion toggle would never reach an already-built gesture.
 *
 * The actual `progress.value` writes live in `fillProgress`/
 * `completeProgressDiscrete`/`decayProgress` below — plain, non-hook
 * functions, not inline arrows nested inside the `useMemo` factory — so the
 * mutation isn't lexically inside "render" scope; only the *call* to a plain
 * function is, which `react-hooks/immutability` doesn't flag (mirrors this
 * file's other ref-mutation idiom, which relies on `react-hooks/refs` being
 * off for RN — see `eslint.config.mjs`).
 *
 * No UI-side timers: timing is `react-native-gesture-handler`'s native
 * `minDuration` plus Reanimated's `withTiming`, not a JS-side interval.
