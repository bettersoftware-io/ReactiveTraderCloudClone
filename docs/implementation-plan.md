## Phase Dependency Graph

```
Phase 0 (Domain Types + Ports)           ✅
    |
Phase 1 (Shared DTOs)                    ✅
    |
Phase 2 (FX Mock Backend)                ✅
    |
Phase 3 (Client Shell)                   ✅
    |
Phase 4 (FX Live Rates)
    |
    +-------> Phase 6 (FX RFQ Flow)
    |
Phase 5 (FX Execution + Blotter)
    |
    +-------> Phase 7 (Analytics Panel)
    |
Phase 8 (Credit Reference Data + RFQ Creation)
    |
Phase 9 (Credit RFQ Tiles + Blotter + Sell-Side)

Phase 10 (Server + Admin) — can start after Phase 1, runs in parallel with Phases 3-9
Phase 11 (E2E + Polish) — after all other phases
```

Phases 6 and 7 can run in parallel with Phase 5 (they depend on Phase 4, not Phase 5). Phase 10 (server) can begin after Phase 1 and proceed independently of client work.

---

## Architectural Decisions

### Mock Backend Location
Mock backend engines live in `@rtc/domain` (pure TS, zero deps). They implement the same port interfaces as the real adapters. The client selects between mock adapters (from domain) and real adapters (WebSocket-based, in client) based on environment config.

### Port Interfaces
All ports use native JS abstractions (`AsyncIterable<T>`, `Promise<T>`) — never framework types like `Observable<T>`. This keeps domain framework-free.

### Dependency Rule
`domain` (zero deps) → `shared` (depends on domain) → `client`/`server` (depend on domain + shared, never on each other).

---

## Phase 0: Domain Types + Port Interfaces ✅

**Package:** `@rtc/domain`

### What was built:

**FX Entities** (`packages/domain/src/fx/`):
- `currency-pair.ts` — `CurrencyPair` type, `KNOWN_CURRENCY_PAIRS` (9 pairs), `deriveBaseTerm()`
- `price.ts` — `PriceTick`, `Price`, `PriceMovementType`, `calculateSpread()`, `detectMovement()`
- `trade.ts` — `Trade`, `Direction`, `TradeStatus`, `ExecutionStatus`, `ExecutionRequest`, `deriveDealtCurrency()`
- `notional.ts` — `parseNotional()` (k/m multipliers), `validateNotional()`, `isRfqRequired()`, constants
- `currency-filter.ts` — `CurrencyCategory`, `matchesCurrencyFilter()`

**Connection** (`packages/domain/src/connection/`):
- `connection-status.ts` — `ConnectionStatus` enum, `nextConnectionStatus()` state machine, `mapGatewayStatus()`, idle/reconnect constants

**Analytics** (`packages/domain/src/analytics/`):
- `position.ts` — `CurrencyPairPosition`, `HistoricPosition`, `PositionUpdates`

**Credit** (`packages/domain/src/credit/`):
- `instrument.ts`, `dealer.ts`, `rfq.ts`, `quote.ts` (discriminated union `QuoteState`), `credit-trade.ts`

**Ports** (`packages/domain/src/ports/`):
- 8 port interfaces: `ReferenceDataPort`, `PricingPort`, `ExecutionPort`, `BlotterPort`, `AnalyticsPort`, `InstrumentPort`, `DealerPort`, `WorkflowPort`

**Tests:** 7 test files, covering spread calc, movement detection, notional parsing, currency filters, dealt currency derivation, connection state machine, quote transitions.

---

## Phase 1: Shared DTOs ✅

**Package:** `@rtc/shared`

### What was built:

**Protocol** (`packages/shared/src/protocol/`):
- `sow.ts` — `BulkSoWMessage<T>` (Variant A), `MarkerEvent<T>` (Variant B)
- `rpc.ts` — `RpcResponse<T>` (ack/nack)

**FX DTOs** (`packages/shared/src/fx/`):
- `reference-data-dto.ts` — `CurrencyPairUpdateDto`, `ReferenceDataMessage`
- `pricing-dto.ts` — `PriceTickDto`, `PriceHistoryDto`
- `execution-dto.ts` — `ExecutionRequestDto`, `ExecutionResponseDto`
- `blotter-dto.ts` — `TradeDto`, `BlotterMessage`
- `analytics-dto.ts` — `CurrencyPairPositionDto`, `HistoricPositionDto`, `AnalyticsDto`

**Credit DTOs** (`packages/shared/src/credit/`):
- `instrument-dto.ts` — `InstrumentDto`, `InstrumentEvent`
- `dealer-dto.ts` — `DealerDto`, `DealerEvent`
- `workflow-dto.ts` — `WorkflowEvent`, `CreateRfqRequestDto`, `QuoteRequestDto`, etc.

---

## Phase 2: FX Mock Backend ✅

**Package:** `@rtc/domain` (`src/mock/`)

### What was built:

- `reference-data-mock.ts` — Emits 9 pairs after 1s delay, no incremental updates
- `pricing-engine.ts` — Random walk (±0.01%/tick), 50-tick history, 150-1000ms intervals, RFQ quote widening
- `execution-engine.ts` — GBPJPY: Rejected (0-2s). EURJPY: Done (4s). Others: Done (0-2s). Auto-increment IDs from 1. Notifies listeners.
- `trade-store.ts` — Accumulates trades from execution engine, keyed by tradeId, reverse insertion order
- `analytics-engine.ts` — 90-point P&L random walk (±0.5%, 10s intervals), static positions for 9 pairs
- `credit-reference-data-mock.ts` — 11 instruments, 10 dealers (no Adaptive Bank)
- `credit-rfq-engine.ts` — Full RFQ lifecycle: 70% dealer participation, price 91-109, 0-30s response delay

**Tests:** 5 test files covering all mock engines.
