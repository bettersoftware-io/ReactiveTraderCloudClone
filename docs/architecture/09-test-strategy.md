## 9. Test Strategy

Tests are layered the same way the system is. Each layer has its own kind of test, and **no test is allowed to import a tool from a layer it isn't testing**.

```
Behavioural Specs (Gherkin)             - WHAT the system does
  |
Step Definitions / Page Objects         - HOW to drive the system today
  |  (Cucumber-JS + Cypress; one tree)
  |
Test Runner / Driver                    - Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, ...
```

### 9.1 Layers

| Test layer | Tests | Tooling-coupled? | Survives technology swap? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Behavioural specs** (Gherkin `.feature` files) | End-user behaviour, scenario style | No -- pure spec | Yes |
| **Step definitions** | Map Gherkin steps to actions | Yes -- import the driver | Rewritten when driver changes |
| **Page Objects** | Encapsulate selectors, waits, intent emission | Yes -- import the driver | Rewritten when UI framework or driver changes |
| **Use-case tests** | Use case behaviour with stubbed ports | Test framework only | Yes (tests import vanilla TS) |
| **Port contract tests** | Same suite run against simulator and WsReal adapters | Test framework only | Yes |
| **Domain entity tests** | Pure functions over entities | Test framework only | Yes |
| **Component tests** (optional) | Render component, assert hook contract is honoured | UI framework + test framework | Rewritten when UI framework changes |
| **UI contract tests** (sociable RTL, [§9.8](#98-ui-contract-tier)) | Mount real components against a scripted `ViewModel`; assert behaviour | Framework-neutral specs + a thin per-framework swap layer | Specs survive; only the `react/` adapter directory is rewritten |
| **Visual goldens** (3 tiers, [§9.7](#97-visual-golden-tiers)) | Pixel screenshots of workspaces × skins × modes | Screenshot runners | Goldens survive — they **are** the cross-framework rendering contract |
| **RN component tests** (jest-expo + RNTL, [§9.9](#99-react-native-testing)) | Render RN screens against the ViewModel | jest-expo | Rewritten with the mobile UI |

### 9.2 Gherkin example

```gherkin
Feature: FX price streaming
  As a trader
  I want to see live bid/ask prices
  So that I can decide when to trade

  Scenario: a price tile shows the latest mid price
    Given the trader has the FX workspace open
    When the pricing service emits a tick for "EURUSD" with bid 1.1000 and ask 1.1002
    Then the EURUSD tile shows bid "1.1000" and ask "1.1002"
    And the spread is rendered as "2.0" pips
```

The same `.feature` file is consumed by:
- **client-side e2e step defs** (Playwright + Cypress — both share one step tree) -- drives a real browser, asserts DOM.
- **application-layer step defs** -- drives presenters directly, asserts hook output, no browser. Fast.

If a browser driver is replaced, only the page-object implementations for that driver change. Replacing React with SolidJS rewrites the page objects but not the specs.

### 9.3 Linking specs to existing project specs

The codebase already contains specs (separate from tests) that describe expected behaviour. The intent is to **converge** on Gherkin: existing specs become the seed for `.feature` files, and the `.feature` files become the single source of truth that all test layers reference. Where today's specs are prose, they will be incrementally rewritten in Given/When/Then form.

### 9.4 Port contract tests

A single test suite is parameterised over **all** adapters that implement a port. The same scenarios run against:
- the in-process simulator,
- the WsReal adapter (against a stub WebSocket server),
- any future adapter (e.g. a different transport).

This is what makes "swap an adapter" a low-cost operation: the contract is encoded in tests and they all must pass.

### 9.5 Twelve-suite e2e stack (6 browser peers + 4 presenter peers + 2 fullstack smokes)

`tests/scripts/run-all.ts` orchestrates **twelve suites**: ten behavioural peers exercising the same spec surface via six binding styles, plus two full-stack smokes (`tests/fullstack/`) that boot a real `@rtc/server` and a real client and assert live WS data end-to-end — the only suites that exercise the server process itself. The ten peers: Cucumber-JS (with Playwright) and Cypress (via cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) bind Gherkin scenarios in `tests/specs/**/*.feature` to a shared step-definition tree. Native `@playwright/test` and native Cypress bind scenarios programmatically through their own step trees. Both the native-Playwright and Cucumber+Playwright peers are additionally duplicated against `@rtc/client-solid` (via `RTC_CLIENT_PKG`, ports 3005/3006), bringing the browser family to six peers. Four presenter-direct peers — **cucumber** (real timers), **cucumber-fake-timers**, **vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers**, and **vitest-fake-timers** (plain) — bind a subset of the same scenarios (tagged `@presenter`) to the RxJS presenter layer in pure Node with no browser; the `cucumber` peer uses wall-clock waits, `cucumber-fake-timers` wraps the same bodies in `@sinonjs/fake-timers` virtual time, `vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers` reruns the same bodies under Vitest + the qpickle-loader Vite plugin for Gherkin + `vi.useFakeTimers()`, and `vitest-fake-timers` reruns the same `_shared/` scenario modules under Vitest + raw `describe`/`it` (no Gherkin loader) + `vi.useFakeTimers()` to prove the `_shared/*.ts` / `_await.ts` / `_world.ts` abstractions are useful even without a BDD step-tree. See Phase 5B.1, 5B.2, 5B.3, and 5B.4 specs for details.

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| Behaviour specs (`.feature`) | Gherkin · Cucumber-JS 11 (Playwright) + cypress-cucumber-preprocessor 22 (Cypress) |
| Step definitions | One shared tree — bundler alias maps `@cucumber/cucumber` → preprocessor for Cypress |
| Native Playwright specs (`.spec.ts`) | `tests/browser/playwright/*.spec.ts` — bind scenarios via `@playwright/test` `test()` bodies; no Gherkin |
| Native Cypress specs (`.spec.ts`) | `tests/browser/cypress/*.spec.ts` — bind cypress-forked scenarios via Mocha `it()` bodies; no Gherkin |
| Scenarios layer (shared) | `tests/browser/scenarios/*.ts` — async fns taking `(ctx: TestContext, args)`; driver-free; used by Cucumber+Playwright, Cucumber+Cypress, native Playwright |
| Scenarios layer (Cypress fork) | `tests/browser/cypress/scenarios/*.ts` — sync fns mirroring shared names 1:1; queue-aware; used by native Cypress only |
| Page-object contracts | TypeScript interfaces; `TESTIDS` and `STRINGS` SOTs |
| Page-object impls (drivers) | `tests/browser/page-objects/playwright/` (Playwright) + `tests/browser/page-objects/cypress/` (Cypress) |
| Per-runner support | `tests/browser/playwright-cucumber/{world,hooks}.ts` (Cucumber+Playwright) · `tests/browser/cypress-cucumber/{world,e2e}.ts` (Cucumber+Cypress) · `tests/browser/playwright/{_context,_openWorkspace}.ts` (native Playwright fixture) · `tests/browser/cypress/{_context,_openWorkspace}.ts` (native Cypress getCtx accessor) |
| Orchestration | `tests/scripts/run-all.ts` — twelve suites in parallel, per-suite dev servers (`RTC_DEV_PORT` 3001+), OR-ed exit codes; `RTC_E2E_MAX_PARALLEL` cap; `RTC_E2E_SKIP_CYPRESS` opt-out |
| Full-stack smokes | `tests/fullstack/{node-smoke,browser-smoke}.ts` + `tests/fullstack/browser/fullstack.spec.ts` — real server + real client on dedicated ports, live pricing/equities assertions |
| Presenter-direct specs | Same `tests/specs/**/*.feature` files, scenarios tagged `@presenter` |
| Presenter-direct step defs | `tests/presenter/steps/*.steps.ts` — bind to presenter streams; no driver imports |
| Presenter-direct scenarios | `tests/presenter/scenarios/_shared/*.ts` — subscribe to RxJS streams with `firstValueFrom + timeout`; shared by all four presenter peers |
| Presenter-direct harness | `tests/presenter/scenarios/_buildApp.ts` (App + simulator + test ConnectionEventsPort) · `tests/presenter/cucumber/{world,hooks}.ts` |
| Presenter-fake-timers runner | `tests/presenter/cucumber-fake-timers/cucumber.js` · `@cucumber/cucumber` + `@sinonjs/fake-timers` — same 20 `@presenter` scenarios under virtual time |
| Presenter-fake-timers harness | `tests/presenter/cucumber-fake-timers/{world,hooks}.ts` (FakePresenterWorld installs/uninstalls `clock` per scenario; `_await.ts` shared `AwaitHelpers` interface) |
| Presenter-vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers runner | `tests/presenter/vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers/vitest.config.ts` · `vitest` + the qpickle-loader Vite plugin + `vi.useFakeTimers()` — same 20 `@presenter` scenarios under Vitest |
| Presenter-vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers harness | `tests/presenter/vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers/{world,hooks,setup}.ts` (VitestFakePresenterWorld implements the same `AwaitHelpers` interface as the cucumber peers; `setup.ts` barrel loaded via `vitest.config.setupFiles`) |
| Presenter-vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers step defs | `tests/presenter/vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers/steps/*.steps.ts` — functional mirrors of cucumber steps with loader import, world-type swap, and `async (state:)` callback shape |
| Presenter-vitest-fake-timers (plain) runner | `tests/presenter/vitest-fake-timers/vitest.config.ts` · `vitest` + raw `describe`/`it` (no Gherkin loader) + `vi.useFakeTimers()` — same 20 `@presenter` scenarios as the other 3 presenter peers |
| Presenter-vitest-fake-timers (plain) harness | `tests/presenter/vitest-fake-timers/_world.ts` (VitestPlainPresenterWorld plain-object factory implementing the same `AwaitHelpers` interface; one `*.test.ts` per feature, beforeEach/afterEach building/tearing down the world per `it()`) |

**Bundler-alias seam (Cucumber+Cypress).** `tests/browser/steps/*.steps.ts` files unconditionally `import { Given, When, Then } from "@cucumber/cucumber"`. Cucumber-JS resolves this natively in Node. Cypress's esbuild bundler (configured in `tests/browser/cypress-cucumber/cypress.config.ts`) installs a plugin that intercepts the `@cucumber/cucumber` specifier and remaps it to the sibling `cucumber-shim.ts`, which wraps `Given/When/Then/And/But` handlers in `cy.wrap().then()` so async step bodies (returning native Promises) are presented to the preprocessor as Cypress Chainables — avoiding the v24+ native-Promise guard — and re-exports everything else from the preprocessor's browser entrypoint unchanged. Both packages expose API-compatible `Given/When/Then/And/But/defineParameterType` decorators, so the same call sites compile cleanly under either resolution. The trick is invisible at the step-file level. Hooks and `World/setWorldConstructor` are NOT shared — they live in the per-runner `tests/browser/{playwright-cucumber,cypress-cucumber}/` directories.

**Native Playwright binding.** `tests/browser/playwright/*.spec.ts` files import a `test` symbol from `./_context.ts`, a Playwright fixture extension that exposes `{ ctx: TestContext }` built from `buildPlaywrightPageObjects(page) + new Scratchpad()`. Each `.feature` file has a sibling `.spec.ts` whose `test.describe` title, `test()` titles, and step ordering mirror the Gherkin 1:1. Three named helpers in `_openWorkspace.ts` (`withWorkspaceOpen` / `withFxWorkspaceOpen` / `withCreditWorkspaceOpen`) map 1:1 to the three Background phrasings, replacing Cucumber's implicit Background mechanism. Test bodies contain only `await scenarios.fn(ctx, ...)` calls — no direct `page.*`, `expect`, or `ctx.po.*` — enforced by grep gates 9–11 in `tests/scripts/grep-gates.ts`.

**Native Cypress binding (Phase 5A.4 §3.3).** `tests/browser/cypress/*.spec.ts` files are pure Mocha `describe`/`it` blocks. Each `it()` body opens with `const ctx = getCtx()` (from `_context.ts`'s module-scoped beforeEach builder) and then calls **synchronous** scenario fns from `tests/browser/cypress/scenarios/*.ts`. No `async`, no `await`, no `cy.*`, no `ctx.po.*`, no driver imports — enforced by grep gates 12–14. The forked `tests/browser/cypress/scenarios/` layer mirrors `tests/browser/scenarios/*.ts` fn-for-fn but uses cy queue idioms: a `chainable<T>` cast helper (in `_chainable.ts`) exposes Cypress's Chainable runtime under the shared layer's `Promise<T>` PO contract; reads call `.then(cb)` on chainables (queue-aware, propagates the subject); cross-call scratchpad reads sit inside `cy.then(() => ...)` to ensure ordering. **The fork was necessary, not desired:** Cypress's command-queue model and Promise-vs-Chainable thenable semantics make the shared async scenarios unusable in native `it()` bodies; four prior combinations were attempted and documented in spec §3.1, §3.2, §3.3 before this design landed. This is the architectural cost that proves the Cucumber-mediated stacks share strictly more (features + step defs + scenarios + Background mechanism) than the native stacks do (only PO contracts + features).

**Presenter-direct binding (Phase 5B.1).** `tests/presenter/steps/*.steps.ts` files use Cucumber-JS but in pure Node — no browser, no DOM, no React. Step bodies delegate to scenarios fns at `tests/presenter/scenarios/_shared/*.ts`, which subscribe to presenter streams (`priceStream.price$`, `connection.status$`, `blotter.trades$`, etc.) via `firstValueFrom + timeout` and assert on emitted values. Background steps are no-ops (workspaces are a UI concern). The `@presenter` tag in `.feature` files selects 20 scenarios that map cleanly to the application layer; UI-only scenarios (theme, hover, CSS, tabs) remain browser-only. `tests/presenter/scenarios/_buildApp.ts` is the sole seam to `createApp(simulatorPorts)`; grep gate 17 enforces it. Demonstrates that the same behavioural specs validate the application layer with no UI framework — closing the loop on [§1.2 rule #4 ("Behavioural Tests as Insurance")](01-overview.md#12-architectural-principles). First sub-phase of Phase 5B; sub-phases 5B.2-5B.4 add variants (fake timers; Vitest+Gherkin; Vitest+plain-TS) as a comparison artifact.

**Virtual-time binding (Phase 5B.2):** the `cucumber-fake-timers` runner reuses the same 20 `@presenter` scenarios as the `cucumber` (real-timers) runner but runs each under `@sinonjs/fake-timers`. The `FakePresenterWorld` implements the same `AwaitHelpers` interface as the real-time `PresenterWorld`, advancing virtual time inside `awaitFirstWithin` via `clock.tickAsync`. Scenario bodies are shared verbatim. Runtime: ~1s vs ~18.6s for the real-time peer (≈19× speedup).

**Runner-portability binding (Phase 5B.3):** the `vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers` runner reuses the same 20 `@presenter` scenarios as the cucumber peers but executes them under Vitest with the qpickle-loader Vite plugin for Gherkin and `vi.useFakeTimers()` (sinon-based) for virtual time. The `VitestFakePresenterWorld` implements the same `AwaitHelpers` interface as `FakePresenterWorld`, advancing virtual time via `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync`. Step bodies are functional mirrors of the cucumber (real-timers) step files differing in three structural ways (`@cucumber/cucumber` → loader import, `PresenterWorld` type swap, and `function(this:)` callback shape → `async (state:) =>` because the loader's `Given/When/Then` types are `(state, ...args) => any` rather than this-bound). The peer is the **runner-portability proof:** the same `_shared/` scenario modules and the same `.feature` files drive cucumber-js *and* vitest under fake timers, validating that `_await.ts` / `_world.ts` aren't accidentally coupled to cucumber-js's lifecycle. Wall-clock: ~1.5s (vs ~1s for `cucumber-fake-timers` — the extra half-second is Vitest worker startup).

**Plain-TS binding (Phase 5B.4):** the `vitest-fake-timers` (plain) runner reuses the same 20 `@presenter` scenarios as the other 3 presenter peers but executes them under Vitest with **no Gherkin loader at all** — hand-written `describe`/`it` blocks in `tests/presenter/vitest-fake-timers/*.test.ts` call the existing `tests/presenter/scenarios/_shared/*.ts` modules directly. The `VitestPlainPresenterWorld` is a plain object literal (not a class) implementing the same `AwaitHelpers` interface as the other presenter peers; `buildWorld()` / `teardownWorld()` run in `beforeEach` / `afterEach`. No step-def files exist for this peer — the test bodies inline what would otherwise be step-def delegation. The peer is the **plain-TS portability proof:** the `_shared/` scenario modules, the `AwaitHelpers` interface, and the `PresenterWorld` shape are abstractions useful enough that a contributor writing presenter tests in raw Vitest tomorrow would not need a new abstraction layer. Grep gate 20 forbids Gherkin loader imports inside `tests/presenter/vitest-fake-timers/`; gate 21 enforces `@presenter` scenario count parity between `.feature` files and `*.test.ts` files via a `customCheck` extension to `grep-gates.ts`; gate 22 asserts every `describe(...)` title in that folder begins with `"@presenter Feature: "`. Wall-clock: ~1.5s (parity with `vitest-quickpickle-fake-timers` — same Vitest worker startup, same fake-timer mechanism).

### 9.6 Port contract test layer

The 8 transport ports (`ReferenceDataPort`, `PricingPort`, `ExecutionPort`,
`BlotterPort`, `AnalyticsPort`, `InstrumentPort`, `DealerPort`,
`WorkflowPort`) each have a contract describer at
`packages/domain/src/ports/__contracts__/<Port>Contract.ts` asserting
happy-path behavioral invariants the TypeScript type signature cannot
catch — emission shapes, SoW protocol, RFQ lifecycle, multi-subscriber
identity. Each describer is parameterised by a `makeHarness()` factory
returning `{port, driver, teardown}`, so the same assertions run twice:
once against the simulator implementation in `packages/domain/src/simulators/`
and once against the WsReal implementation in
`packages/client-core/src/adapters/portFactory.ts` driven by an in-memory
`FakeWsAdapter` that scripts canonical wire frames from
`packages/shared/src/__fixtures__/wireFrames.ts`. The equities port trio has
the same treatment (`wsRealMarketData.contract.test.ts`, `portFactory.equities.test.ts`
in `client-core`).

The contract is happy-path only. Error semantics (RPC nack handling) are
covered by three `wsReal<Execution|Pricing|Workflow>.errors.test.ts`
files outside the contract, since simulators have no equivalent failure
mode. Gate 23 (see §12) keeps the describers pure: they receive a port
via `makeHarness`, they don't reach into either implementation.

### 9.7 Visual golden tiers

`packages/client-react/tests/ui/visual/` runs the same screenshot scenarios through **three independent rasterizers**, because each one draws slightly differently and each catches different regressions:

| Tier | Runner | Config |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Playwright Component Testing | `playwright-ct/` (also hosts the whole-app **paint smoke** — the guard against "renders in jsdom, paints empty in a real browser" bugs) |
| 2 | Plain Playwright over a Vite host | `playwright/` |
| 3 | Vitest browser mode (`toMatchScreenshot`) | `vitest-browser/` |

Two golden sets are committed per tier: `__screenshots__/react/` (rendered on pinned x86 CI — **the canonical cross-framework contract**) and `__screenshots__/react-local/<platform>-<arch>/` (local runs, committed for review but never compared on CI). The render target lives behind the `visual/react/` seam barrel — the directory a SolidJS port swaps.

**Updating goldens** is its own operational runbook — the two sets, the three update routes (dispatch the CI workflow / regenerate locally in Docker / the native fast loop), and which to run for a regression vs. a deliberate change vs. a new scenario: [`packages/client-react/tests/ui/visual/UPDATING-GOLDENS.md`](../../packages/client-react/tests/ui/visual/UPDATING-GOLDENS.md).

How `client-solid` runs these same three tiers **assert-only** against these goldens — never writing one of its own — is [§21 Mechanism 2 — assert-only visual tiers](21-cross-framework-testing.md#mechanism-2--assert-only-visual-tiers).

### 9.8 UI contract tier

`packages/client-react/tests/ui/contract/` is the second framework-swap pillar: **sociable RTL tests** where framework-neutral specs (`specs/**/*.contract.spec.ts`, per domain) drive framework-neutral page objects (`shared/pages/`), and only the thin `react/` directory (component registry, render adapter, `viewModelFromWorld`) knows React exists. CI enforces **≥95%** statement/branch/function/line coverage on this tier (`test:ui:contract:coverage`) — the strongest single gate in the repo, because it measures how much of the UI the swap-portable suite actually pins down.

The `UiContractDriver` seam that lets the same specs run against `client-solid`'s Solid render target instead of React's is [§21 Mechanism 1 — the contract swap-trio](21-cross-framework-testing.md#mechanism-1--the-contract-swap-trio).

### 9.9 React Native testing

The RN package runs a **dual runner** (`vitest run && jest`):
- **vitest** (node) for pure logic: chart geometry (`buildChart`, `buildCandles`, `buildGauge`, `buildSparkline`, `bubbleLayout`), port selection (`buildNativePorts`), theme tokens, the AsyncStorage adapter.
- **jest-expo + RNTL 14** for ~50 colocated component tests (`*.test.tsx`), mapping `@rtc/*` to built `dist/`.

CI additionally runs an **Expo export smoke** (Metro bundling of the real app) to catch monorepo-resolution breakage that jest never exercises. Two gaps are known and deliberate: no RN e2e yet (Maestro is the deferred plan) and no RN visual goldens — jsdom/jest cannot see paint, so whole-branch review + the live simulator remain the net for RN paint bugs.

### 9.10 The CI gauntlet

The blocking gauntlet is two **parallel** jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered on PRs and pushes to `main`. The ~20-min visual-diff job is **not** among them: it runs post-merge only, in its own `.github/workflows/visual.yml` (triggered on push to `main` — i.e. right after a PR merges — plus manual `workflow_dispatch`), so branch pushes are never blocked while the UI is still churning. A red post-merge visual run is the signal to inspect the diff and either fix the regression or regenerate the goldens (via `update-visual-goldens.yml`). To restore it as a PR gate once the UI stabilises, move the job back into `ci.yml` **and** re-add `visual diffs` to `main`'s required status checks — both halves, or you get a gate that runs-but-doesn't-block or blocks-but-doesn't-run.
